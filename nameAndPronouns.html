	<p>I like to be called Joann some days and Jonathan on other days. I will wear a pink wristband on my left wrist during "Joann" days and a blue wristband during "Jonathan" days.<br>
	I am fine with you using my legal name (Jonathan Means) if it is necessary. However, I greatly appreciate it if you can refer to me as "Joann-Jonathan in emails, meetings, and other contexts where my legal name is not strictly necessary. Feel free to link to this page directly if others ask about my name.<br>
	I use they/them pronouns. If it helps, you can imagine that I'm a pair of conjoined twins.<br>
	For example:
	<ul>
		<li>They sent in their resume yesterday.</li>
		<li>I talked to them in an interview.</li>
		<li>Their resume is formatted well.</li>
	</ul>
	If you make a mistake, I may correct you. This isn't a personal judgement, just repeat what you said and fix the pronouns.<br>
	I hope you found this page helpful. I'm happy to answer questions about my name or pronouns as they come up!</p>
